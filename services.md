# What I can do for you

I provide off-site document review services.

You can send me any documents you wish to improve, and I will edit them, send back queries, and provide a finished product.

This service is recommended for all kinds of different technical documents, including:

 * standard operating procedures
 * technical specifications
 * user manuals
 * policy documents

I can provide any ‘level’ of editing work – from a final last-minute polish, to simply having a whole stack of random papers thrown my way with a request to make them into something coherent.
